In this package we will define a set of services as interfaces. Each service provides a set of operations.

If you need to create a service called 'Serv' for example you have to follow the following steps:

1. Create a interface called 'ServFacade' in this package (org.acoes.business).
2. Create the implementation of that interface in the subpackage impl. Call that class as 'ServFacadeImpl'.
3. This class must be a singleton, so you have to add the following lines:
```
//Singleton
private static ServFacadeImpl instance = null;

private ServDAO dao;
    
private ServFacadeImpl(){}
    
public static ServFacadeImpl getInstance(){
    if(instance == null){
        instance = new ServFacadeImpl();
    }
    return instance;
}

public void setServDAO(ServDAO dao){
    this.dao = dao;
}

public ServDAO getServDAO(){
    return dao;
}
```

ServDAO is an interface between the business and data tier. This interface defines a set of read-write operations
over the stored entities. More information about this in the package org.acoes.model.dao.
