At present there are more than 200 Honduran volunteers who support the development of the various projects, with the help of international cooperation and hundreds of volunteers from Spain, the United States, Canada, France,....."></h:outputText>

            <h:outputText value="Volunteering is one of the main pillars that characterizes and distinguishes ACOES. We understand volunteer work as a form of solidarity towards the most disadvantaged population and as a sign of social responsibility towards social injustices. We are a team composed entirely of volunteers, both Spanish and Honduran, who seek a more just and dignified world for the Honduran population, working without any economic remuneration, with the same objective and with the same illusion."></h:outputText>

It is the young Honduran collaborators who act as the backbone of the organization to coordinate and manage the different projects directly from Honduras, while from Spain support is given to all activities in multiple ways such as grant management, recruitment of new scholars, awareness and much more."></h:outputText>
